# Mushroom-Broker

This game is fairly simple.
All you need to do is clone it via github, and then run the mushroom.py file. It'll load a simple game and explain how to play.
The player must press space to start.
The M1 button is used to click on mushrooms to increase score while a timer counts down.
When the timer reaches zero, the game ends, and you may press esc to end it.
Simply re-run mushroom.py to play again and aim for a higher score.
